          <p id="two">
            I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from KLE Institue
            of Technology Hubbali , where I graduated in May 2023. My coursework
            encompassed a range of subjects, including Algorithms and Data
            Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, Database Management
            Systems, and Web Development. Prior to my university education, I
            completed my Pre-University Course (PUC) at Anmol Science PU College
            Davanagere, graduating in May 2019. This foundational period
            provided me with a comprehensive understanding of key concepts that
            laid the groundwork for my subsequent studies. My educational
            journey began with the completion of my Secondary School Leaving
            Certificate (SSLC) at Sri Venkateshwara Vidya Samste Gollarahalli in
            May 2017.

            1.Tourism management->The goal of this project is to create a simple
            tourism management website using HTML,CSS, JavaScript, PhP,
            Bootstrap that can help tourists to access available tour packages
            and book without accessing offices and they have features of
            tracking and controlling their bookings, accessing tour history,
            password and profile update <br /><br />
            2.Heart Disease prediction->In project work, the major challenge in
            heart disease is detection. There are instruments available which
            can predict heart disease but either they are expensive or are not
            efficient to calculate chance of heart disease in human. Early
            detection of cardiac diseases can decrease the mortality rate and
            overall complications. Since we have a good amount of data in
            today's world, we can use various IoT enabled machine learning model
            to analyze the data for early prediction of heart disease.
